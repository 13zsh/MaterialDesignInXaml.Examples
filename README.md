## Material Design in XAML (MDIX) Samples

If you are just getting started, take a look at these [5 steps for getting started with MDIX](https://intellitect.com/getting-started-material-design-in-xaml/)

A collection of small samples using [MaterialDesignInXaml](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit).

Samples may be in various states of "done". If there is some concept you would like to see demonstrated please open an issue.
PRs happily accepted as well.
